// TODO: create an `index.js` that calls your function with three paths from process.argv
//   and then logs the contents of the three files to the screen
//   TODO: (your console.log should be  in the index.js file not in your print-files function)





// TODO:  Write tests that guarantee that the files are logged in order.
// TODO:  You will also need to look up and implement async testing, making sure that you are not getting "false positives" (tests that are passing but shouldn't be).
