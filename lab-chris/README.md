## Description
401 JS -- Class 03 fs async lab

Took Duncan's demo code and started from there. Created a module from my print-files.js page. Added a function to get it to print from my index.js page. Had trouble figuring out how the process.argv method on index just takes the place of the path argument print-files.js and spent far too much time. As soon as I was shown I was a little upset that it was really just that easy. Everything works.
